# Cylinder2DFlowControlDRLParallel

Parallelizing DRL for Active Flow control.

The code will be publicly released upon publication of our manuscript under review (see preprint here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10382.pdf ). (TODO: check this is well the latest version that is provided by this link).

This is basically an extension of the code presented in our JFM paper: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/artificial-neural-networks-trained-through-deep-reinforcement-learning-discover-control-strategies-for-active-flow-control/D5B80D809DFFD73760989A07F5E11039#fndtn-information for which the code is already on github: https://github.com/jerabaul29/Cylinder2DFlowControlDRL .

Using a parallel training allows to cut the training time from a couple of days to less than 2 hours.
